## Description

This playground was inspired by the lack of engagement many of my classmates in university have toward theoretical computer science subjects. It is an implementation of The Game of Life proposed by mathematician John Conway’s in 1970.

I believe that students feel less invested in theoretical subjects because of the lack of opportunity to apply and experiment with most of the concepts presented during classes. The Game of Life is an excellent tool to fill the gap between the theory and the application of some concepts studied during the course.

Along with the basic implementation, I also developed a challenge mode in which the player can actually play and try to beat the emerging complexity of the game in a kind of domination game.
